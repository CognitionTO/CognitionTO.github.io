# Welcome to CognitionTO

Located in Toronto's vibrant Corktown neighborhood, CognitionTO offers a dynamic and flexible space for AI enthusiasts, tech innovators, and entrepreneurs. At 60 Sumac St., in the iconic Magic Building, we blend a modern café atmosphere with the energy of a coworking hub.

By day, it's a comfortable and casual workspace, and by night, it's a venue for the most exciting tech and AI workshops and networking events in the city.

## Our Space

### Public Café
Grab a coffee or snack while mingling in the front of the building. It's a laid-back spot to meet like-minded individuals or just relax.

### Coworking Space
The back section is reserved for our members and day pass holders. Here, you'll find hot desks, lockers, and a focused environment perfect for work and collaboration.

### Event Space
The back wall of the coworking space features an elevated stage. The coworking tables can be rolled away to support chairs for 50-60 people or standing room up to 100 people.
